					<h3>Sailing</h3>
					<p class="sail-desc">Sailing has been my passion since I was 14 years old. I worked hard to earn my sailors license at 18, and I have since spent countless hours exploring the lakes of Poland. While I enjoy the peacefulness of lake sailing, my ultimate goal is to sail on the Baltic sea. To achieve this, I plan to work on obtaining a radio license so that I can safely navigate those waters. For me, sailing is not just a hobby, it's a way of life!</p>

					<h3>Disc Golf</h3>
					<p class="disc-desc">Disc golf is my latest obsession. I discovered this amazing sport in the middle of 2022 and I haven't looked back since. What I love most about disc golf is that it's easy to pick up, but incredibly challenging to master. It's the perfect way to get some exercise and fresh air while also having fun with friends. Whenever I introduce someone to disc golf, they always have a blast and end up wanting to play more. As one fellow casual disc golfer told me, "It's like a walk in the park, but with a disc."</p>
