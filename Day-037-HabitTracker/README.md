# Habit Tracker with Pixela

This habit tracker uses Pixela to show my reading progress!

Using Pixela's API endpoint and HTTP Methods like POST, PUT and DELETE

With a quick function call I can track my reading progress

Rather than using API authentication, I am using a more secure Requst Header, which allows me to pypass showing my API token with every request
