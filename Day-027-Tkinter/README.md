# Tkinter GUI Program
My first introduction to a GUI in Python!
I have created a simple mile to kilometers converter, using the tkinter python library
GUIs make it easier to navigate your program, as opposed to using a terminal
Why have I just realized that 0-60 mph is not the same as 0-100 kilometers?
